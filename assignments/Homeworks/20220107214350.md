# Background on Numerical Stability of estimation methods

Consider a SDE

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t,t) dt + \sigma(X_t,t) dW_t
$$
And a method of estimation

$$
X_{n+1} = f(X_n,t_n)
$$
## Mean Square stability
MSS occurs when

$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \inf} E((X_n)^2) = 0
$$
I.e. when the variance drops to zero.
## Asymptotic Stability

AsmS occurs when
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} | X_n | = 0
$$
With probability one
